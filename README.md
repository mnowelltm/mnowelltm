- 👋 Hey Hey, I’m @mnowelltm - Michael 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying and preparing to take the CCNA by the end of the year. I love ethical hacking and outsmarting people, so I spend a ton of time on this especially with the awesome tools Kali Linux has to offer. Actually many, if not aleady in the Kali distro, I pull from Github. 
      If you dont understand how a packet moves accross a network, you will never understand computing IMO. You have got to undertand how a packet, moves from point a to point b and if you dont, its gonna ba a tough road. 
     I also plan on getting my CompTIA Linux+ certification next which should be pretty easy as I use Linux all the time. I also love that Windows now comes with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
      Linux just facinates me. It can run on the smallest devices that barely have any hardware to speak of. I actually have a Raspberry Pi that is my DNS server that runs Linux. 
      I use VMWare Workstation, for money reasons, I am not an enterprise, with whatever OS I want to fire up on a VM to learn or exploit. I used to manage all this a previous company, I  just never took the time to get certified. 
      And finally we come to learning Python. I need to get on that one quick as I want to get into DevOps as well. The first language I lever taught myself was C#. I am by no means an expert, but I was able to write simple programs that we used at some of my companies. The best thing it did was teach me the concept of OOP. 
      
    I used to have a pretty nice website I wrote using the LAMP stack, but its been long gone. I need to build another website I just dont have any ideas. Any from you would be appreciated.
